# ChaosPlotter
Plot chaos using Python/Kivy
## What is it?
TODO, but google "Chaos theory" and "bifurcation"
## How to run?
1. `git clone https://github.com/InCogNiTo124/ChaosPlotter && cd ChaosPlotter`
2. *(Optional but strongly recommended)* Build a virtualenv and activate it
3. `pip install kivy`
4. `garden install --app tickmarker graph`
5. *(Maybe some steps in between, such as installing Cython and building tickmarker manually)*
6. `python chaosplotter.py`
7. Enjoy!
### TODO: make build bash script
